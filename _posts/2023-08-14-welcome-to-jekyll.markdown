# Sliding Window Algorithm

The sliding window algorithm is a technique used for efficiently processing arrays or lists by maintaining a 'window' of elements and sliding it to process subarrays or substrings.

## Basic Concept

Imagine you have an array of integers, and you want to find the maximum sum of a subarray of given length `k`. Instead of using a brute-force approach and checking sums for all subarrays, you can use the sliding window approach:

1. Calculate the sum of the first `k` elements.
2. For each next element in the array, add it to the current sum and subtract the first number of the previous window.
3. Compare the new sum with the previous max sum and update accordingly.

This approach allows us to process the array in O(n) time instead of O(nk) if we used brute force.

## Applications

The sliding window technique is versatile and can be used in various problems:

- Maximum/minimum sum of subarray of size `k`.
- Longest substring with `k` distinct characters.
- String anagrams.
- ... and many more.

## Conclusion

The sliding window algorithm is a powerful technique that can significantly optimize certain array and string problems. By understanding its underlying concept and recognizing patterns in problems, one can apply this method to solve challenges more efficiently.
